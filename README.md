# GLua Syntax Highlighting For Pterodactyl
This modification for [Pterodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel) adds [Garry's Mod Lua](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Main_Page) syntax highlighting for the built in file editor.


### Installation
1. Download the contents of the repository.
2. Copy the files into your Pterodactyl installation, you will be overriding 3 files, these are: editor.js, ext-modelist.js and ext-settings_menu.js.
3. That's it, now try and edit any lua file on your server with the built in file editor to test it works!


### Side Notes
- GLua syntax highlighting will be used on all Lua files when using this modification, it is unlikely that you will need to edit any regular Lua files through the editor so there is no added support for this to work only on Garry's Mod servers.
- You are fully responsible for any damages caused to your panel when using this modification, it has been tested so it is likely that any errors are caused by you and not my code.
